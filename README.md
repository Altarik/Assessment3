# Assessment3

Assessment 3 shows how to manage code quality on the run cycle and Git versioning (tag, Merge...)

- Each Tag reflects a user story (defined on the assessment)
- Quality is optimed on the run
- Asbtraction is used once duplicated code is detected
- The latest 3 Features were first merged before refactoring their result on the Master Branch

Feel free to use the GUI application to test the output of each requirement
